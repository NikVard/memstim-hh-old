# memstim-hh
MEMory STIMulation, a dynamical computational model of theta-nested gamma oscillations w/ theta phase reset interfacing Kuramoto oscillators with Hodgkin-Huxley neurons.

The model described here was used to produce the [following publication in eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/87356). If you use this work or refer to the model, please cite the original work accordingly.

To run the model, follow the setup instructions found in [setup-env/instructions.txt](setup-env/instructions.txt).

# UPDATE
The repository has been cleaned-up to remove large results files. To clone the repository and run the model, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/NikVard/memstim-hh-updated) instead.
